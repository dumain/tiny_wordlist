# Customized EFF Diceware Wordlist

The EFF has published a [great set of diceware wordlists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) and an [informative diceware page](https://www.eff.org/dice).  The wordlist can also be found in the EFF's [eff_diceware repo on GitHub](https://github.com/EFForg/eff_diceware).
This repository contains a modified wordlist based on the EFF's 5-die "large" list.

PhilThompson replaced 3,609 words, including:
  - words of 8 or more characters,
  - hard-to-spell words,
  - words with homophones,
  - words that could make for unpleasant, unsavory, or politically insensitive passphrases,
  - some compound words that might be difficult to remember as a single "word,"
  - words with common alternative spellings,
  - words containing non-alphabetic characters, and
  - other words that seem out of place in a wordlist.

He replaced most of the removed words with 3-6 character words from [hermitdave's FrequencyWords repo](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/).

This created a list with sufficient short (<4 character words) to make a 4 dice wordlist.
I intend to use this repo to make such a wordlist.  It isn't there yet.
